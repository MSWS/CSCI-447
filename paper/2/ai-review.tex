I used ChatGPT 4-o with the file upload functionality to upload the paper's PDF.
The prompt was `Please write one paragraph summarizing this article, and one
paragraph giving constructive feedback for the article.'.

Without thorougly reading the paper, it appears that the summary that the AI provided
was sufficiently accurate, and the feedback similarly addressed an area for improvement
that I had not considered. Without looking closely at the AI's output and the paper,
it would be hard to notice any discrepancies.
