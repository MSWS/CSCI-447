\title{Uniprocessor Virtual Memory without TLBs}

\begin{document}
\maketitle
\textbf{The paper is about a study done on the performance of a uniporcessor system that
achieves virtual memory without specific harwarde componenets.}
\textit{The paper was written to explore the performance gains (and losses) of such a system.
One major benefit is increased flexibility over hardware state machines.}
\ul{The paper used simulated memory management systems to measure the perforance of both traditional hardware-based TLBs, and software-based TLBs.}

The paper often refers to acronyms that are introduced formally the first time.
When jumping around the paper, it can be difficult to know what an acronym stands for.
A table of acronyms and their meanings would be helpful for readers to quickly reference.
Table 1 refers to an `I-Side' and `D-Side', and an `I-TLB' and `D-TLB' respectively,
though it is not clear what these terms mean.
