`Implementing Remote Procedures Calls' \textbf{discusses a new package that
    provides a remote procedure call facility, and describes its structure,
    facilities, and metrics such as performance.} \textit{This paper was created
    to introduce and essentially `advertise' the new RPC facility for the
    `Cedar' project, which attempts to resolve issues that arise when designing
    a facility (such as communication failures, address-containing arguments,
    binding, protocols, data integrity/security, and others)}. \ul{The research
    was conducted within the `Cedar' programming environment and the Xerox
    research network. Their measurements and metrics included varying argument
    inputs, word array size, and instructions (rewind + unwind.)}

The paper tackles implementing RPC into their specific environment, though I
think describing the current paradigm of RPC (especially its current
implementation) outside of their environment, and why they chose against using
pre-existing infrastructure.  This way, having a comparison table of other
software in contrast to their RPC implementation would allow for a better
understanding of both the shortcomings and the improvements made. The paper also
references some measurements that aren't embedded within the article directly
(and are instead linked as a bibliography reference). Appending these directly
referenced diagrams as an appendix would allow for more convenient reference.
