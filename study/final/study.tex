        \item Pass paramater via registers
        \item Save parameters in block/table (memory), pass via registers the
              address of the block
        \item Placed onto the stack
    \end{enumerate}
    \subsubsection*{Working Set Model}
    \begin{description}
        \item[Main Idea] Consider pages a process needed in the past, and
            use as indicator of pages needed in the future
        \item[Locality] A set of pages actively used together
        \item[Spatial Locality] Page references close in time are located near
            to each other in space
        \item[Temporal Locality] A page is referenced repeatedly in some unit of time
    \end{description}

    Essentially a \emph{sliding window} of time \(t = \Delta\) that moves over the page
    requests a process makes.

    \begin{multicols*}{2}
        In modern systems, \(\Delta\) is in the 5000 - 15000 range. \\
        If the WS size of process \(i\) is \(WSS_i\)\dots

        \begin{equation*}
            D = \sum_{i=0}^{n} WSS_i
        \end{equation*}
        \columnbreak \\
        If total demand \(D\) is greater than count of available frames,
        thrashing will occur. \\
        The OS monitors WSS for each process, and
        allocates for each enough frames to its working set size. If there are
        `free' frames, initates another process. If too few, a process is
        suspended.

    \subsection*{Threads}
    \subsubsection*{Many-to-one} All user threads map to a single kernel thread \\
    If a user thread makes a block system call, the entire process (made up of
    multiple user threads) will block Because only 1 thread can access the
    kernel at any one time, multiple threads are unable to run concurrently on a
    multicore computer

    \vspace*{-1em}
    \subsubsection*{One-to-one} Each user thread is mapped to a unique kernel thread \\
    The creation of a user thread requires (considerable) overhead to create a
    kernel thread. If a user thread is idle (perhaps waiting on another thread
    to finish), then the kernel thread with which the user thread 1s associated
    is needlessly consuming kernel space resources When one thread is blocked
    (user or kernel thread), the other threads can continue. Concurrency is
    enabled

    \vspace*{-1em}
    \subsubsection*{Many-to-many} Many user threads are mapped to a \(\leq \#\)
    kernel threads At the user level, multiple threads are created, and it is up
    to the OS to schedule/orchestrate/map each of them to a kernel thread

    \subsubsection*{Critical Section Problem}

    \begin{description}
        \item[Mutual Exclusion] If a process is executing its critical section, no others can be executing theirs
        \item[Progress] If no process is executing its critical section, AND
            some process wants to enter its, only those processes NOT executing can
            decide who enters
        \item[Bounded Waiting] There must be a limit on the number of times another process is allowed to enter its critical section after a process has made a request to enter its critical section (i.e., no starvation).
    \end{description}

    \subsubsection*{Semaphores}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Must be careful NOT to omit an inc/dec in code.
        \item Global, thus must know how entire program works to use them
        \item Can't infer which waiting process will run next
    \end{itemize}

        \item[SC] The signaler continues, and the signaled executes at some later time
        \item[SW] The signaler waits until some later time and the signaled executes immediately

        \item[RMS] Upon entering, a process is assigned a priority inversely
            proportional to its period. (i.e., the shorter the period, the
            higher the priority). P2 would be broken up into two chunks (30 / 5)
            at t=50.
        \item[EDF] Upon entering, a process is assigned a priority inversely
            proportional to its deadline. (i.e., the sooner the deadline, the higher
            the priority).
    \end{description}

    By design, real-time CPU scheduling does not permit a process that has
    already met its period deadline to start a second time in the same period.

            The \(m-n\) highest order bits are needed to address into the page
            table.

                Thus, the logical address gives us some \((p, d)\). We use \(p\)
                to index into the page table to find the correct frame \((f)\), with the
                offset of \(d\) (which is from the \(n\) lower bits of the
                address). Thus our physical address is \((f, d)\).
            \end{multicols*}
            A single datum in logical address space still requires reserving the
            entire frame for that datum. Internal fragmentation refers to the
            unused space within a frame/page.
            \subsubsection*{Downsides}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Every mapping MUST go through page table
                \item A page table can be implemented via registers, but this limits their size
                \item One solution is putting it in main memory, and having the PTBR point to where it is
            \end{itemize}

    \subsubsection*{Inverted Page Table}
    A SINGLE page table regardless of how many processes.
    CPU generates a pid, page number, and offset.
    \begin{multicols*}{2}
        Search the entire page table for <\(pid, p\)>.
        The \emph{index} of that entry is the frame number.

        \subsubsection*{Belady's Anomaly}
        The phenomenon in which increasing the number of page frames results in
        an increase in the number of page faults for certain memory access
        patterns.
    \end{multicols}
    \subsubsection*{Effective Access Time}
    \begin{equation*}
        EAT = (1 - p) \times ma + p(fault)
    \end{equation*}
    \subsubsection*{Copy-on-Write}
    If two processes rely on the same pages in physical memory, the OS can
    allocate a single page to both processes. If one process writes to the page,
    the OS will allocate a new page to the process that wrote to it, and `copy'
    the contents of the original page to the new page.

    \subsection*{Miscellaneous}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item T/F: If segmentation is used, and the total free (unallocated) main memory is
              128MB, then the OS can place into main memory a segment of size 64MB.

              False - Holes might be tiny

        \item RMS is neither optimal nor guaranteed to work even if CPU util is \(< 1\)
        \item Given \(n\) invocations of \texttt{fork}, there will be \(2^n - 1\) child
              processes
        \item An I/O request would induce a process changing from running -> waiting.
        \item For a logical address space of 16 bytes, among which there are 8 pages, and
              assuming the use of a page table:

              \begin{itemize}
                  \item For the corresponding physical memory, each frame is 2 bytes
                  \item The last byte of frame 1 has a corresponding logical memory address whose offset is 1
                  \item The 3 highest bit of the logical address are used to index into the page table.
              \end{itemize}

              Reasoning:
              \vspace*{-2em}
              \begin{align*}
                  2^4 \Rightarrow m                  & = 4                                                \\
                  2^3 \Rightarrow n                  & = 3 \text{ bits for page table index}              \\
                  16 \text{ bytes} / 8 \text{ pages} & = 2 \text{ bytes per page \emph{and} frame}        \\
                  m - n = 4 - 3                      & = 1 \text{ bit}       \text{ for the offset}       \\
                  \text{Last byte of first frame }   & = \underbrace{000}_{\mathclap{\text{page index}}}1
              \end{align*}
        \item As the number of frames allocated to each process decreases, \emph{overall page fault} rate goes up
